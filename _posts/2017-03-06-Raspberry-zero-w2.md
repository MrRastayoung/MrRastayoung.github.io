The Raspberry Pi 3 is the third generation Raspberry Pi. It replaced the Raspberry Pi 2 Model B in February 2016. 
Compared to the [Raspberry Pi 2](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/) it has:

* A 1.2GHz 64-bit quad-core ARMv8 CPU
* 802.11n Wireless LAN
* Bluetooth 4.1
* Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)

Like the **Pi 2**, it also has:

* 1GB RAM
* 4 USB ports
* 40 GPIO pins
* Full HDMI port
* Ethernet port
* Combined 3.5mm audio jack and composite video
* Camera interface (CSI)
* Display interface (DSI)
* Micro SD card slot (now push-pull rather than push-push)
* VideoCore IV 3D graphics core
* The Raspberry Pi 3 has an identical form factor to the previous Pi 2 
(and Pi 1 Model B+) and has complete compatibility with Raspberry Pi 1 and 2.

We recommend the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B for use in schools, or for any general use. 
Those wishing to embed their Pi in a project may prefer the 
[Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-zero/) or 
[Model A+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-a-plus/), 
which are more useful for embedded projects, and projects which require very low power.
